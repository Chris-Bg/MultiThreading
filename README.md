Completed tasks: 
1. I chose the theme "Rooms reservation" for which I created multiple threads that run simultaneously.
2. I used methods to create threads by using Thread and Runnable (in different classes).  
3. In the main file, I created a callable task using a lamba function, that automatically reserves a room, with a random number.
4. I used multi-threading for event creation over timeâ€”for example, in the room reservation project, every 3 seconds, a thread should be created automatically to simulate a ticket reservation. The thread should start, execute the reservation, and then close while the application continues running (for about 1 minute).
5. Besides all that I used the concepts of ExecutorService, ScheduledExecutorService and Future.
